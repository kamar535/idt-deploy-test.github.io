Uppsala University provides a number of services that are necessary for your
studies or greatly facilitate your studies. An activated student account is
required for most of the services we describe in this module.

You should have already received information on how to activate your student
account together with your acceptance letter. If you have been accepted for
studies at Uppsala University but have not yet activated your student account,
you can do so [here][activate].
