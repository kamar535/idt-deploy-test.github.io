## Learning objectives

After passing this module, you will know how to:


- enter data to a spreadsheet.
- manipulate data in a spreadsheet. 
- create a graph based on data in a spreadsheet.
- add trendlines to charts.
- to visualize the \\(R^2\\) value of a trendline.

## What you need

To do this assignment you need: 

+ A computer with Microsoft Office Excel installed.

The Microsoft Live verison of Excel does not support trendlines, you must use
Excel installed on a computer. 

- You may use any other spreadsheet software that is capable of generate similar
  charts as requested in this assignent.

## Preparations

Create a new Excel document named `abcd1234_excel.xlsx`, where you
replace `abcd1234` with the username of your student account.

## Assignment

In this assignment you will create a chart. Start by entering your student
account username (similar to abcd1234) in cell `A1`. Next, enter the following
data in the range `B1:D11`.

``` text
x	Fib	2^x
1	1	2
2	1	4
3	2	8
4	3	16
5	5	32
6	8	64
7	13	128
8	21	256
9	34	512
10	55	1024
```

Now you are ready to create a **Scatter Plot** chart with the `x` values on the
horizontal axis and the `Fib` and `2^x` values on the vertical axis. The chart
should include the following: 

+ A title.
+ Data points.
+ Exponential trendlines.
+ Axis labels.
+ Data point labels. 
+ Trendline labels. 
+ Regression analysis: (\\(R^2\\)) values for the two trendlines. 

The finished chart should look similar to this.

## Submit in Studium

Save the Excel file with the name `abcd1234_excel.xlsx`, where you
replace `abcd1234` with the username of your student account. Submit the text
file in Studium.
