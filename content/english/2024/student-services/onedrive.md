Instead of storing your files locally on one of the university's
computers, you should always use OneDrive. With OneDrive you can store
your files in one place, share them with others and access them from any device
connected to the Internet.

With OneDrive you can work on one of the university's computers, save a file in
OneDrive and later access the file in OneDrive from your private computer.

## File explorer

Among the icons in the taskbar you find the **file explorer**.

[MFA](microsoft/#activate-multifactor-authentication-mfa) on your mobile phone.

When you log in for the first time, the following window appears.
