At Uppsala university, the eduPrint system is used for printing, copying and
 scanning. The printing system provides **Follow Me** printing:
 
-  printouts are sent to a central print queue instead of you selecting a
   specific printer.
- eduPrint stores the printout until you go to any of the eduPrint connected
  printers identify yourself with your [campus-card][campus-card].
