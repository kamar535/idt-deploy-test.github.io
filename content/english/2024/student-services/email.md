## Forwarding

If you don't plan to check the university email frequently it is strongly
recommended to forward your student email to another of your email addresses. 
Click on the settings cog at the top right to configure email forwarding.

## Email etiquette 

When writing an email to a teacher or other university staff, there are a few
things to keep in mind.

### Subject

Many employees receive hundreds of messages a week. A relevant subject helps the
recipient prioritize and search among different messages.

If the matter concerns a particular course, include the
course code already in the subject. An example of a subject 
may look like this:


``` text
1TG298 autumn 2024 - The Student services assignment
```

### Give context

Begin the message by clearly explaining who you are. If your message is about a
specific course, clearly identify the course and when you took the course. 
A continuation of our example could look like this.


``` text
My name is Anna Anderson and I studied the course 1TG298 in autumn 2024.
```

### Keep it short and to the point

Next, keep the message short and to the point with the most
important first. In our example, the message could continue like this.


``` text
I have now re-submitted the Student Services assignent. Although I'm very late,
I hope someone has time to grade my sumbisson. 

Sincerely,

Anna Andersson
```
