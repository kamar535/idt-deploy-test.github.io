Most courses end with some form of written examination, usually in the form of
an in-person exam in a physical exam hall at the university. Sometimes take home
exams are used instead. 

## You must register for exams

You register for exams by logging into [Ladok](../ladok). Current exam
registrations are shown on the start page. 

## Register at least 12 before the exam

You must register for an exam no later than 12 days before the exam. 
If you are not registered for an exam, you will not be allowed to take the exam.

It is generally a good idea to register as early as possible. You can cancel an
exam registration up to 12 days before the exam.

## Exam details

If you registered for an exam you will receive an e-mail a few days
before the exam with detailed
information about the exam. This information includes the time and
place of the exam, as well as an anonymity code that you must provide during the
exam. 

## Exams are scanned

All exams written within the Faculty of Science and Technology (TekNat) at
Uppsala University are scanned. This means that you will get your
corrected exam back digitally (there is still the option to collect the exam on
paper).

Your scanned exams are accessed via the [My Exams][my-exams] TekNat service. Scanned exams
remain on the server for two years.
