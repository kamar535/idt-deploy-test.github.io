Late submissions after the courses ends will be marked during the re-exam
periods.

**TBA:** These dates are yet not decided and will be announced later. 

If you hand in a supplement at the beginning of a retake period there will be
time for you to get it marked and if necessary resubmit it again within the same
retake period. If you submit late in a retake period and will have to resubmit
again, you will have to wait until the next retake period to get your assignment
marked again.
